                <p>
                    Im really grateful that I have you in my life.
                    You are the reason why Im excited to wake up everyday.
                    You are my heart, my strength, and the one who makes every day brighter. I can never thank you enough
                    for the love and happiness you bring into my world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Im so sorry for being clueless and dumb sometimes.
                    Itâ€™s never my intention to hurt you or make you feel anything less than cherished. I promise I'll
                    try harder, to be the best for you, and to never take for granted the beautiful person that you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your patience, for your kindness, and for always understanding me.
                    I'm so lucky I have you in my life.
                    I LOVE YOU SO MUCH PO.
